01 Drawing:
With this prompt my aim was to creating an emoji which I believe I did by using circles, arcs and ellipses. I also made use of strokes and strokeweight which set the colours and thickness for the shape. By setting my strokeweight at 25 I manage to make a sort of distorted smiley emoji which I thought had a symbolic effect as it represents how an individual can mask their true intentions of text with an emoji. As this was my first project a lot of my processes were trial and error as I usually learn best through visuals and experimentation. 


02. Movement:
With this prompt I was inspired by an artwork we were shown in class called 'A Throw Of The Dice Will Never Abolish Chance' which gave me the idea to combine my skills of poetry with my project. This became the base for my project as I used my favourite poem that I've ever written - 'Crooked' and applied movement to the words using framecount and trigonometry. This specific project took a lot of research and online videos from youtube as I wasn't very confident in my skills when i first had the idea. I watched many different videos from online tutors such as LSL Gerla, Patt Vira, ext. In the end I was very proud and managed to use fonts from google and slightly distort my text which I thought matched the themes of the poem.



03.Multiples:
There wasn’t much of deep theme behind this one. It was simply inspired by an accident that Tom made sound cool. After following Tom’s instructions in class I made a couple differences by accident which made a sequence of black circles bubbling up on one another on the screen which Tom said reminded him of ‘Venom” which I found really cool as this fictional character had a huge impact on one of my favourite marvel characters which is Spiderman - taking over his body and giving him power whilst fueling his rage at the time leading to many irrational decisions. I ended up doing research, watching YouTube videos and asking friends as I wanted to expand on this which I did by using a loop to draw multiple circles, then expanding using a growth variable. This made an effect where the black bubbles would grow across the screen until it covers it whole which for me recreated the Venom Symbiote taking over Spiderman or ‘Eddie Brock’ - another one of Venom’s hosts. 


04.Media 
In this prompt, I aimed to use videos and picture I had edited or shot myself to create a collage but this one ultimately failed due to two reasons - a lot of my picture files weren't compatible with Javascript and the second I had difficulties programming it but overall I believe I was still able to use everything taught to us by Tom and embed a video with sound as well as a picture into my code using preloads, coordinates and the mousepressed function. When going onto the preview you must tap for the video to start and once more for the picture to show also making this an interactive experience.
